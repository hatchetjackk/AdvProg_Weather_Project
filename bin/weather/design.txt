1. GOAL

The Weather Data program takes user input for temperature, windspeed, and dewpoint then 
calculates windchill and cloud altitude.

2. METHOD

The program initializes with a GUI that allows the user to determine if they want to use data
that is manually entered via the keyboard or entered automatically from a file. Each window
offers the user the opportunity to close the program with a "cancel" button. 

Keyboard entry is a simple window that allows for three inputs that accept integers within a
specific range. If the user inputs a value above or below that range and clicks the "calculate"
button, a window is printed to the screen identifying the issue and offering a solution. This
screen has a "go back" button to return to the first window and a cancel button to close the
program. Calculating the information will print it to the bottom of the window.

File entry gives the user a file chooser to pick a (.csv?) file with predetermined input that
will calculate and output the information to a new window.

3. Complete Rewrite

The code needed to be cleaned up. During this time I figured out some clever command combinations to 
make the code cleaner and easier to read. Computations were split into their own methods, and input 
fields have been properly addressed to accept correct integer values. Arraylists were added to store 
data that can then be pushed to WeatherWin for display. The FileChooser will select text files with CSV,
but this needs to be finished.
